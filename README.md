admission into the knowledge house
my name is monet washington
I am currently a sophmore attending cuny new york city college of technology
my dream is to work at a startup company one day
i've been working on my goals by applying to every single free coding bootcamp
so far i've been unlucky, but that hasnt stopped me 
this summer i've attended infor's hackathon the the infor convention at the jacob javitz center
i was granted access to the event because i took a infor mongoose course
i should be accepted into the java script training program because i am passionate about technology, im smart, i play hard and i work hard.
